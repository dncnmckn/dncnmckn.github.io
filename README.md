This is a working copy of my Product Design portfolio created using Bootstrap + FontAwesome + Brackets + Github.

When Each section is completed, it will be duplicated in a special template file as the homepage of my WordPress blog / CMS located at http://duncanmckean.com. Using a WordPress template page ensures that all the blog and other posts and pages retain their original style.
=======
This is my experimental design portfolio. As in the way it is coded, not the content. Although that could be experimental too thinking about it. We'll see.
