Hello, I'm Duncan. I design things. 
==================


I believe every good designer should be able to:

Research. Observing blatant and latent user needs gives you the strongest foundation for innovation.

Collaborate. You canâ€™t do everything on your own. Working as part of a team leads to better results.

Write. Recording your process and methodologies allows you to reflect and improve what you do.

Teach. Show people what you do and how you do it. Spread your knowledge, skills and experience.

Projects. Here's some things I've been up to.
